                   <h3>Our Mission Statement:</h3>
                   <p>LoveBento is an app that encourages users to send love to their loved ones. By adding "hearts” to the calendar, users can get notifications by the app to remind themselves to send love with their preferred love languages.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   
                   <h3>Who We Are:</h3>
                   <p>LoveBento was designed, developed and prototyped by Michiru Ishikawa '24, CJ Jin '24 and Cheryl Wang '23 for Catherine Delcourt's CS220 Human-Computer Interaction at Wellesley College.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   
                   <h3>What We Used:</h3>
                   <p>The initial sketch was digitally drawn on Procreate and recreated using Google Slides and InVision. Later, Figma was used to develop the final prototype.</p>
                   <p></p>

                   <h2 class="mb-5">Love Languages</h2>
                   <p>Your love language is how you express love to your loved ones. Love Bento has five love languages in total (Acts of Service, Gifting, Physical Touch, Quality Time, and Affirmation) and allows users to select up to three preferred languages that resonate with them the most. 
                       Users select their love languages when they first set up their accounts. However, users can easily change them on the love language and analytics page by clicking the “Add or Change your love language” button. </p>
                   <p class="mb-0">You can see each definition below:</p>

                   <p></p>
                   <h3>Acts of Service:</h3>
                   <p>Being a thoughtful friend or partner is your way of showing the people around you that you care. No matter how big or small, you’re always happy to help.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h3>Gifting:</h3>
                   <p>Gifts are a tangible way for you to show or receive love. For you, gifts represent emotions, feelings or core memories.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h3>Physical Touch:</h3>
                   <p>Touch is a way for you to communicate your emotions nonverbally. You prefer close proximity and physical affection to let others know how you cherish them.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h3>Quality Time:</h3>
                   <p>Spending your time with someone gives you a sense of “togetherness”. To you, nothing means more than when your partner/friend and you are focused only on each other in this impossibly large universe.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h3>Affirmation:</h3>
                   <p>You enjoy directly communicating your thanks and affection. You love supporting and uplifting people to make them feel loved.</p>
                   <p></p>

                   <h2 class="mb-5">User Analysis</h2>
                   <p>In Pset 1, we interviewed several students around us and asked them how often they contacted their parents/guardians, how far away they were from their parents/guardians, how often they said “I love you” to their parents/guardians, and finally if getting reminders would cause them to be more likely to contact their parents. Most of our participants were Asian-American, which caused some interesting takeaways that we think can help us narrow our app to something more centered on first/second-generation immigrant children.</p>
                   <p class="mb-0">We identified mainly two problems from our interviewees:</p>
                   <p>&emsp;1) There’s the need to express gratitude and love to their loved ones across cultural barriers and in different cultural expressions. </p>
                   <p>&emsp;2) The need to be reminded to express gratitude and love to their loved ones and to be given the chance to connect and bond with their loved ones on a deeper level. </p>
                   <p class="mb-0">We also realized that our initial plan was too broad because we were trying to be widely applicable while a lot of the Asian-American participants we interviewed wanted something a little more niche. Therefore, we concluded that we wanted to center on Asian-American students’ experiences and needs a little more, although, of course, it would be applicable to everyone else as well.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h3>"I think [an app] will help because I do forget when’s the last time I said 'I love you' to them. I will probably tell them more often if there is a tracker."</h3>
                   <h3>"It will be better if there can be something to help find conversation topics and help cross language barriers to help better connect with parents."</h3>

                   <h3>Persona</h3>
                   <p>Based on our interviews from P1, we formalized a persona that helps guide our design process. Our persona, Anna Grace Lee-Honda, is a Japanese Chinese high school student who wants to connect with their loved ones and show gratitude more often. She wants an app that gives her reminders to contact her parents and keep track of the numbers of how many times she said “I love you” to her parents. However, Anna’s native language is English and she speaks Japanese and Chinese poorly. Her parents are immigrants so sometimes she finds it hard to connect with them or their culture. Thus, she wants to learn how other users, who are facing language barriers as well, start their conversations with parents. </p>

                   <h3>Task Analysis</h3>
                        <img src="assets/img/taskanalysis.jpg">
                   <p class="mb-0">Through our task analysis, we focused on three main tasks:</p>
                   <p>&emsp;1) Get reminders to contact parents (loved ones) and connect with them</p>
                   <p>&emsp;2) Keep track of progress</p>
                   <p>&emsp;3) Learn conversation topics</p>
                   <h3>Design Sketches</h3>
                   <p>Based on our persona and task analysis, we created 2 design sketches.</p>
                   <p class="mb-0"><b>Pros and cons for Design 1:</b></p>
                   <p>&emsp;Pros: We liked how accessible this design was. We created a footer navigation bar at the bottom, so the user is always able to locate the three core parts of our app that we think they’ll always be using (the calendar, the chat function, and the topics/forum page). Although we changed the core parts in the final prototype, the navigation bar still remained to be the app’s core navigation tool. In this design, we thought having today’s events all on the home page can be a good way for the user to receive information and look at what needs to be done.</p>
                   <p>&emsp;Cons: The footer appeared to be clunky and cluttered. This also minimized the amount of space that a user has to view the contents of a page, which isn’t something we want because a phone is already so small and has limited space. Potentially, the way that the user is receiving information is too cluttered and prevents them from viewing it in a way that could help them receive information.</p> 
                   <p class="mb-0"><b>Pros and cons for Design 2:</b></p>
                   <p>&emsp;Pros: We like how sleek this design looks. It’s cleaner than the other design, and we give the user a lot of space simply by allowing the menu to be accessed/hidden with the click of a button. <b>We liked the idea of putting the calendar on the home page.</b> The most important information that our app offers is how many times they expressed love to their loved ones, so having it on the homepage/having it on its own page is definitely a question we want to explore further. With its consistency and simplicity, design 2 became our base design for our final prototype. </p>
                   <p>&emsp;Cons: The scrolling design may prevent the user from accessing all the information they want in a page. We want users to be immediately able to access important information without boring them with too many clicks (aka better efficiency). However, with our current design, it would require a lot of scrolling to do everything we want.</p>

                   <h3>Developing our low-fidelity prototype</h3>
                   <h4>&emsp;Deciding on a design direction:</h4>
                   <p>After receiving feedback from our initial presentation, we decided to focus on the core aspects of our app instead of attempting to subject our user to too much information. We believe that much of what makes our app unique is our calendar, which helps the user keep track of how often they have shown gratitude to their parents. Therefore, we moved our calendar to our home page, much like our second design. However, we decided to keep the core elements of the first design as many people said that the second design had too many tabs and could be overwhelming. We decided to simplify a lot of what we had for both designs in order to provide the user with a more simple and straightforward approach. We also decided to take out the parent aspect of the app (such as having parents download the app) to focus more on our target audience, the college-aged students.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <h4>&emsp;Identifying “risky” interactions</h4>
                   <p>A “risky” interaction is the calendar, as the app orients around its usability. We are also worried about the part involving choosing the user’s love language, as that requires a lot of components and our app wants to adapt based on the current love language.</p>
